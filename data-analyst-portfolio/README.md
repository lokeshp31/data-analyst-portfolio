# Data Analyst Portfolio (Lokesh Potluri)

This repo aggregates three mini-projects that demonstrate core Data Analyst skills across **SQL**, **Power BI**, and **Python/pandas**.

## Structure
- `SQL-Projects/retail_sales/` – SQLite DB loader + analytics queries
- `PowerBI-Dashboards/retail_sales/` – Clean CSV + build steps + suggested DAX
- `Python-for-Data-Analysis/retail_sales/` – pandas analysis + plot output

## How to Use This Portfolio
1. Start with the **Power BI** folder to familiarize yourself with the dataset and build a dashboard.
2. Use the **SQL** project to answer business questions with queries.
3. Use the **Python** project to show scripting, KPIs, and plotting.
4. Add screenshots of your dashboard to the Power BI folder and **to your LinkedIn Featured section**.

## Talking Points
- Which categories/states/segments drive revenue and profit
- Time trends and seasonality
- Profit margin vs. volume tradeoffs
- AOV and order distribution

## Next Steps
- Add a second dataset (e.g., customer churn, marketing campaign)
- Write a short blog post in the repo README describing 3 insights you found
- Post the dashboard screenshots on LinkedIn with 2–3 bullets of insights
